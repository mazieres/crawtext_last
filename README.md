# Crawtext

Yet another tiny crawler in Python.

Crawtext starts crawling **seeds**, which can be provided by the user or via [Bing Search API](http://datamarket.azure.com/dataset/bing/search). It **extracts relevant** content of the page using [Boilerpipe](https://code.google.com/p/boilerpipe/). If the page contain the **crawl's query**, URLs are extracted from the selected content. If they are not considered as spam by [adblock](https://adblockplus.org/), they get crawled at the next round until the wished depth is reached.

Crawtext save the JSON-formatted results in a file. Each result is a pertinent crawled page with its:
+ `pointers`: The pages in the given dataset pointing to this page.
+ `content`: The extracted content from the page in text format.
+ `outlinks`: The pages in the given dataset pointed by this page.

## Installation

Dependencies on `beautifulsoup`, `requests` and `boilerpipe`, all of them being available through [pip](http://www.pip-installer.org/en/latest/installing.html).

## Usage

crawtext('algues vertes OR algue verte', 				# query
		0, 												# depth
		'/Users/mazieres/code/crawtext/results.json',		# absolute path to result file
		bing_account_key='============================================', # Bing Search API key
		local_seeds='/Users/mazieres/code/crawtext/myseeds.txt') 		# absolute path to local seeds
